# Flutter Product List Challenge

This project is a solution for a product listing challenge, simulating part of a "queue skipping" system for clothing stores, using Flutter, Cubit + Repository architecture, and best modularization practices. The app features a modern, visually appealing UI with search, category filter, cards, and smooth user experience.

## Features
- Product listing consuming the public API [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
- Displays image, title, price, and category
- Category filter
- Search bar for product name
- Dynamic pagination (incremental loading on scroll)
- Modern card-based UI with padding, shadows, and color highlights
- Friendly error handling and retry button



## Project Structure

```
lib/
	main.dart                # App setup and providers
	models/
		product.dart           # Product data model
	repository/
		product_repository.dart# API access logic
	cubit/
		product_cubit.dart     # State management (Cubit)
		product_state.dart     # State definitions
	screens/
		product_list_screen.dart # Main product screen (with search, filter, cards)
	widgets/
		product_list_item.dart # Widget to display a product (styled card)
		category_dropdown.dart # Widget for category filter
```


## Data Flow
1. **main.dart**: Initializes the app, injects the repository and Cubit, and displays the main screen.
2. **ProductRepository**: Responsible for fetching products and categories from the API.
3. **ProductCubit**: Manages the screen state (loading, error, list, filters, pagination) and exposes interaction methods.
4. **ProductListScreen**: Main screen, consumes Cubit state and renders the UI, including search bar, category filter, and product cards.
5. **Widgets**: Reusable components for product items (cards) and category filter.


## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
	```
	flutter pub get
	```
2. Run the app:
	```
	flutter run
	```
